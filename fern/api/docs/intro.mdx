### API Up-time

<P style={{lineHeight: "2rem"}}>
<span>String is built to be highly reliable. As such we aim for 99.9% uptime.
 Because we're consistently releasing impovements for String while maintiaing high reliabilty, 
 we have a daily maintanence window where the API may be down for as long as 20 minutes.
 Our maintanence window is from 11PM PT to 12pm PT in order to minimize service interuptions.</span>

### Base URL

Our endpoint is available via HTTPS at `https://api.meetstring.com`.

### Authorization

String uses Basic Authorization with Base64 encoding of your credendtials to secure your requests. 
To access the endpoint, please use Base64 to encode your username and password combination.<br/>  
Encoding your credentials are as easy as seperating your username and password with a colon (username:password) and then encoding the resulting string with a Base64 plugin or tool.<br/>
An example of how to use Base64 to encode your username and password combination can be found [here](https://www.base64encode.org/).<br/>
<br/>
You can also use something like the Base64 package in node.js and run b64.btoa('username:password') to encode your credentials. They should look like 'Basic <your encoded credentials>' when you're done.
<br/>
Your credentials will be provided to you by the String team.  
Do not share these credentials outside of your organziation because any requests made with your credentials will be billed to your account.
