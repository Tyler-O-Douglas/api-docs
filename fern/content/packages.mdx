### How String Handles Packages
Out of the box String has two options for handling packages. 1) If you want String to find the smallest package
based on items you're shipping, add an array of items to the "Items" property in the order object you send to String. 
2) If you want to provide the package and weight yourself, add an object to the "Package" property in the order object that you send to String.
You must provide either a package or set of items for String to return anything.
For either option you select, the repsonse from String will contain both the dimensions and weight of the selected package (parcel).  
Additionally, the respinse from String will include a package code that you can use to determine how to configure your shipping label.

### Package Codes

String will return one of the following package type codes to indicate how your parcel will be rated by the carrier selected.
This is important because String can select between flat rate options offered by carriers and standard rates based on the size and weight of your package.
In some cases, carriers let you use your own packaging for flat rate serivces.  For example FedEx One Rate allows this for qualfiying packages.

In addition to the package code, String will also include details about the parcel you should use to make sure your shipping label is configured properly.
This information will be retruned to you as an object with key 'parcel'.
Please refer to 'API REFERENCE' -> 'Least Cost Fulfillment' for an example of how package information is returned to you via the API.
