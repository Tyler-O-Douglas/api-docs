### Package Codes

String will return one of the following package type codes to indicate how your parcel will be rated by the carrier selected.
This is important because String can select between flat rate options offered by carriers and standard rates based on the size and weight of your package.
In some cases, carriers let you use your own packaging for flat rate serivces.  For example FedEx One Rate allows this for qualfiying packages.

In addition to the package code, String will also include details about the parcel you should use to make sure your shipping label is configured properly.
This information will be retruned to you as an object with key 'parcel'.
Please refer to 'API REFERENCE' -> 'Least Cost Fulfillment' for an example of how package information is returned to you via the API.
