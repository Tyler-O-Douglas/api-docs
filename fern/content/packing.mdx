### How String Handles Packing

String is the only API that finds the smallest package for any given order even when deformable items or packages are included.
Deformable items are things like t-shirts that can be folded, crushed, or otherwise made to occupy a different set of dimensions than its original form factor.

As of today, String can only handle packing orders into a single package.  We are working on adding support for multiple packages.
In addition to returning yor own custom packaging, String can also return flat-rate packaging options from carirers like USPS, FedEx, and UPS.

To have String find the smallest package for an order, you have two options for providing String with your product information. 

1) Provide String with a set of skus that String holds modelling information for.
2) Provide String with a set of items where you define their dimensions and weight.

Do not mix these two options.  If you are providing skus for one item, you must provide skus for all items.  
If you are providing dimensions and weight for one item, you must provide dimensions and weight for all items.

If you choose option 2, String is not able to calculate deformability. 
For either option you select, the response from String will contain both the dimensions and weight of the selected package and the items in it.  


#### Flat-rate Packaging

If String returns a flat-rate packaging option, it will be appended to the same object as the custom package String returns to you.

#### Deformable Items and Packages

When you elect for String to store models of your items in our database, we are able to calculate their deformability.
When calculating deformability, String will create multiple itterations of a product in different form factors to find the smallest package that fits all of the items.
Because deformability varies by product, material, your process, and packaging, we highly encourage your feedback and testing to ensure that String is returning the best results for your business.

Similarly, String calcualtes package deformability. Package deformability also depends on many factors. 
We also encourage your feedback and testing to ensure that String is returning the best results for your business.

Models for packages and products can be updated by the String team at any time to reflect your feedback and testing.
